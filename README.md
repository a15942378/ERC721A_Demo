# ERC721A_Demo

The smart contract made when NFT was popular

front end project is RWDDemo

learned a lot of relevant knowledge

For example, randomly generate pictures, layer stacking, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), NFT feature files„ÄÅcontract verification

It was a joyful learning experience though I gave up for some reason in the end
